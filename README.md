# stranslate

## Simple translator to russian language (Based on yandex API).

It demands yandex translate API key to be putted into key.txt file.

If it runs with argv[1], it will be pasted into input text box.

I binded command 'python program.pyw "$(xsel -o)"' on hotkey and now I can translate selected words.
